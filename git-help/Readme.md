# Getting Started With Git

## Download Files From Git

Go to the repository where you want to download files. On the top right hand side of the repository you will find a green button Clone or download. Click on the button you will have the option of downloading the repository as a zip file that you will then extract and get the files you want from the extracted resource. Secondly and more useful you can use the url to download the repository using git command line tool or git CLI (command line tool)

## Using VSCode

Open VSCode you will see on the left of the screen a button to clone a repository. Click the button. From the repository that you want to clone copy the URL from the green Clone or download button. For this course you can [clone the dominait/web repository](https://github.com/dominait/dmit1530.git[https://github.com/dominait/web.git). You will then be asked to save the remote repository localy select a location. This is where you will find your files for this course.

## Other Methods To Clone a Git Repository

The most efficiant way to work with git is through the command line interface or git cli. This requires spending sometime learning basic git commands. I highly recommend searching youtube and watching a beginers guide to git. You can try this one from [simplylearn]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIa9CejUcQM). A full indepth look at git is outside the scope of this course. You should have a working knowledge of github and git-cli. In time we may see it integrated into this course fully but not yet. So ask your instructor if you want to know more.
