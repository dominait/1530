# Deploying Static Sites To Netlify
One of the quickest and easiest things you can do to speed up your static site speed load time is to serve it via HTTP2. Netlify is an amazing free service that serves your static sites using HTTP2. Not only does it give you this for free but there is a free page but it aslo will:
* write pretty URL's
* Bundle CSS in a single file.
* Minify CSS
* Bundle JS into a single file.
* Minify JS
* Compress images.

 Not only does it give you free asset optimization with a click of a button it also give you the option to prerender you  pages. Prerendering you pages is something you will definatly want to have turned on especially when developing static sites. 
 You can read more about prerednered pages [here].

 [prerendering pages](https://www.netlify.com/docs/prerendering/)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [here].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes 
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.
